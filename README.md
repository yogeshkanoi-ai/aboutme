### Inclusive product design
**[Publication](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240020644A1)**

- The system collects likeness scores for product attributes from users through surveys before the product design phase.
- Uses multi-level machine learning models to determine the impact and relative contribution of each product attribute to the inclusivity score for each user.
- Segregates product attributes and inclusivity scores at the persona level and calculates feature importance scores for each attribute per user.
- Calculates a risk score for each user, indicating their sensitivity to product designer choices, and provides what-if analysis for assessing the risk based on the user's sensibility.
- Receives multisensory reviews from users to enhance decision-making for product designers.
